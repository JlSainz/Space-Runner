# INTRODUCTION
First project working with JS and Canvas. It's based in a runner that has to jump or telepransport the fire balls that will try to kill him.

# HOW TO PLAY
Jump with the space bar.
The first 3 times you use de arrow keys yo will have a teletransport and after you can only run.
And try to travell all the light years that you can!

# IMPROVEMENTS
The movement of the fireballs and the gravity of the runner should be improved.
The music and the difficulty of the levels.
A little problem with the colisions in the bottom left corner of the screen.
